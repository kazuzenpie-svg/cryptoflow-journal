CryptoFlow Journal PRD (Updated Final Draft)
1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Name
CryptoFlow Journal
1.2 Product Description
CryptoFlow Journal is a web-based React application for crypto traders and investors to manually log, manage, and analyze cryptocurrency trades (spot, futures) and investments (DeFi, dual investment, liquidity pool, liquidity mining). Powered by Supabase (database, auth, real-time), it features a Trader-Investor model where Traders manage portfolios and share read-only metrics with bound Investors (min. 3, max. 10 in free tier; premium unlocks higher limits). The app offers a simplistic, modern UI inspired by Phantom Wallet, with rounded corners, professional yet approachable graphics, and interactive snackbar notifications.
1.3 Goals and Objectives

Primary Goal: Deliver an intuitive platform for journaling crypto trades and investments with tailored forms, robust analytics, and secure Trader-Investor data sharing.
Secondary Goals:

Enable real-time portfolio transparency for Investors.
Track cash flows and performance metrics in USD or PHP.

5. Assumptions

Manual entry for trades/investments (no exchange/wallet APIs).

No onboarding tutorial; users understand crypto basics.
Premium features (exports, higher binding limits) planned but WIP.
Manual P&L for investments simplifies tracking across platforms.


Addressing Your Idea

Distinct Categories and Forms:

Trades (spot, futures) and investments (DeFi, dual investment, liquidity pool, liquidity mining) have tailored forms with category-specific fields (e.g., leverage for futures, APY for DeFi).
Implemented via a single Trades table with category and details (JSONB) to keep the schema flexible.
UI will render dynamic forms based on category (e.g., DeFi form includes platform and APY inputs).


Manual P&L for Investments:

Traders manually input P&L for investments to account for platform-specific complexities (e.g., impermanent loss, staking rewards).
P&L is optional for trades (auto-calculated if applicable) but mandatory for investments (enforced in app logic).
Benefits: Simplifies MVP, ensures accurate P&L from Traders’ external data, and provides consistent metrics for Investors.


Database Support:

Trades table updated with category (spot, futures, defi, etc.) and details (JSONB) for fields like platform, APY, or pool share.
profit_loss column added for manual input on investments.
Audit log tracks P&L changes for transparency.


//DATABASE DESIGN
Updated Supabase Database Schema
Design Principles (Updated)

Category-Specific Forms: Separate forms for trades (spot, futures) and investments (DeFi, dual investment, liquidity pool, liquidity mining) with tailored fields.
Manual P&L for Investments: Traders manually input P&L for investments to account for platform-specific calculations.
Simplicity: Use a single Trades table with a JSONB column for category-specific fields to avoid excessive table proliferation.
Security: Maintain Supabase RLS for Trader-Investor access control.
Currency Support: USD and PHP for all price/P&L fields.
Scalability: Support 1,000+ entries per user with real-time updates.

Updated Tables
The main change is to the Trades table, which will now handle both trades and investments with a category column to differentiate types and a details JSONB column for category-specific fields. Other tables (Users, Bindings, Audit_Log) remain unchanged from the previous schema unless noted.

Notes:

category determines the form fields displayed in the UI:

Spot: asset, price, quantity, trade_date, fees, notes, details (e.g., { "buy_sell": "buy" }).
Futures: asset, price, quantity, trade_date, fees, notes, details (e.g., { "buy_sell": "buy", "leverage": 10, "margin": 1000 }).
DeFi: asset, price (initial investment), quantity, trade_date, fees, profit_loss (manual), notes, details (e.g., { "platform": "Aave", "apy": 5.2 }).
Dual Investment: asset, price, quantity, trade_date, fees, profit_loss (manual), notes, details (e.g., { "platform": "Binance", "strike_price": 50000 }).
Liquidity Pool: asset (e.g., 'BTC-ETH'), price, quantity, trade_date, fees, profit_loss (manual), notes, details (e.g., { "platform": "Uniswap", "pool_share": 0.01 }).
Liquidity Mining: asset, price, quantity, trade_date, fees, profit_loss (manual), notes, details (e.g., { "platform": "SushiSwap", "rewards_token": "SUSHI" }).


profit_loss: Optional for trades (calculated as (sell_price - buy_price) * quantity - fees if applicable); mandatory for investments (manual input by Trader).
details (JSONB) stores category-specific fields, allowing flexibility without multiple tables.
currency ensures all monetary fields (price, fees, profit_loss) are in USD or PHP.

Relationships (Unchanged)

Users ↔ Trades: One-to-Many (Trades.user_id → Users.id).
Users ↔ Bindings: One-to-Many (Bindings.trader_id → Users.id, Bindings.investor_id → Users.id).
Users (Investor) → Users (Trader): One-to-One (Users.bound_trader_id → Users.id).
Trades ↔ Audit_Log: One-to-Many (Audit_Log.trade_id → Trades.id).

Row Level Security (RLS) Policies (Updated)
Updated to handle trades and investments in the Trades table:

Users Table: Unchanged.

Read/Update: Users access their own profile (auth.uid() = id).
Trader UID: Investors read trader_uid; Traders read their own.


Trades Table:

Create/Update/Delete: Traders modify their own entries (auth.uid() = user_id).
Read: Traders read their own entries (auth.uid() = user_id). Investors read their bound Trader’s entries (auth.uid() = Users.id AND Users.bound_trader_id = Trades.user_id AND Bindings.status = 'approved').
Ensure profit_loss for investments is only editable by Traders.


Bindings Table: Unchanged.

Create: Investors create requests (auth.uid() = investor_id).
Update: Traders approve/revoke (auth.uid() = trader_id).
Read: Traders see their bindings; Investors see their status.


Audit_Log Table: Unchanged.

Create: Auto-generated via triggers.
Read: Traders only (auth.uid() = user_id).



Example RLS Policy (Trades Table, Updated)
sql-- Traders: Read/Write their own trades/investments
CREATE POLICY trader_access ON Trades
  FOR ALL
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
  WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Investors: Read bound Trader's trades/investments
CREATE POLICY investor_access ON Trades
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM Users u
      JOIN Bindings b ON b.trader_id = u.bound_trader_id
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid()
        AND b.investor_id = auth.uid()
        AND b.status = 'approved'
        AND Trades.user_id = u.bound_trader_id
    )
  );

Addressing Your Idea

Distinct Forms: Using a category column and details JSONB allows tailored forms in the React UI. For example:

Spot: Simple buy/sell form.
Futures: Adds leverage and margin fields.
DeFi: Adds platform and APY fields, with manual P&L input.
This keeps the database flexible while supporting unique UIs per category.


Manual P&L for Investments: Requiring Traders to input P&L for investments (defi, dual_investment, liquidity_pool, liquidity_mining) is a good approach for MVP, as platforms like Aave or Uniswap have complex P&L calculations (e.g., impermanent loss, staking rewards) that are hard to automate without API integrations. The profit_loss column is optional for trades (auto-calculated if needed) but mandatory for investments (enforced in app logic).
Benefits:

Simplifies MVP by avoiding external data fetching.
Gives Traders flexibility to input accurate P&L based on their platform data.
Investors see consistent P&L metrics across all categories.


Considerations:

App logic must validate profit_loss for investments (non-null).
UI should guide Traders to enter P&L for investments (e.g., with a clear input field and snackbar confirmation).
